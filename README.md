# Spectrumind
Welcome to Spectrumind, a transformative online platform dedicated to promoting pride representation, raising awareness about mental health, and fostering well-being within the LGBTQ+ community and beyond. Our project is fueled by a deep commitment to creating a more inclusive and compassionate world, where every individual feels seen, accepted, and supported.
1. Pride Representation: At Spectrumind, we strive to celebrate the rich diversity of identities within the LGBTQ+ community. Our aim is to provide a safe space where individuals can freely express their authentic selves, share their stories, and find inspiration. Through empowering narratives, vibrant artwork, and engaging content, we aim to amplify voices that have been marginalized and break down societal barriers.
2. Mental Health Awareness: We recognize the profound impact that mental health has on the well-being of individuals, especially those within the LGBTQ+ community. Spectrumind is dedicated to shedding light on the unique challenges faced by this community and providing resources, support, and information to help navigate those struggles. Our goal is to reduce stigma, foster understanding, and create a culture of empathy and acceptance.
3. Well-being and Empowerment: Spectrumind believes in the power of holistic well-being. We aim to empower individuals by providing tools, resources, and guidance that promote self-care, personal growth, and resilience. Our goal is to nurture a community where mental, emotional, and physical well-being are prioritized, leading to a stronger and more vibrant community overall.

## User Experience (UX)

A group of unlikely coders with various abilities came together to produce a website dedicated to representing the LGBTQ+ community and bring awareness to others about the struggles encountered by the community throughout history and up to the current day.
The concept of the name Spectrumind developed from the idea of connecting mental wellness and the human brain and associating the light spectrum to a community defined by its rainbow colors.
Key information for the site
•	What does it mean to be a part of the LGBTQ+.
•	How can we support members of the LGBTQ+ community who suffer with feeling ostracized by society.
•	Where can we learn about the history and accomplishments of the community as well as important figures and icons.
•	What can we do to help people who struggle to understand their role in the community.
•	When do events happen throughout the year that promote awareness.

### Colour Scheme

We wanted to choose colours that reflected the environment, so we have chosen a variety of blues, purples and pinks for our site.
![Colour Palette](https://coolors.co/ff5252-e1bee7-114069-c2dfe8-bc5bbc)
<!--> Completed <--> 
### Typography

Google Fonts was used for the following fonts

Amatic and Josefin fonts are the main fonts used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. Amatic and Josefin are clean fonts used frequently in programming, so they are both attractive and appropriate.

### Imagery

All images used on this project are free copyrights. They are used within the site has been chosen to showcase the LGBTQ+ community. The images are also used to add visual interest to the website and to help break up different sections of the page. Imagery is relevant to the content and mission of the website and is also appropriately sized and optimized for web use to ensure fast page loading times.

### Wireframes

Add the images or links for your wireframes here.

There are lots of different options to create your wireframes - Code Institute students can access [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) as part of the course.

Some other options include [Figma](https://www.figma.com/), [AdobeXD](https://www.adobe.com/products/xd.html), [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&adgroup=uxui&device=c&matchtype=e&utm_campaign=ADDICTMOBILE_SKETCH_GAD_DG_UK_T1_ALWAYS-ON_S_TRF_PROS_BRAND&utm_term=sketch&utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_content=TOF_BRND__generic&hsa_acc=8710913982&hsa_cam=16831089317&hsa_grp=134620695759&hsa_ad=592060065319&hsa_src=g&hsa_tgt=kwd-14921750&hsa_kw=sketch&hsa_mt=e&hsa_net=adwords&hsa_ver=3&gclid=Cj0KCQjwr4eYBhDrARIsANPywCjRIFn93DMezYnsyE5Fic_8l8kynJtut0GYMU01TiohHjwziFtlH0gaAhteEALw_wcB) and [Mockup](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mockup-sketch-ui-ux/id1527554407) to name just a few! Or you can even go old school and get those wireframes completed using pen and paper. Just snap an image of the completed wireframes to add the images to the README.

## Features

The website is comprised of four pages, three of which are accessible from the navigation menu (home page, books page & contact us page). The fourth page is a contact page that allows the user to submit their details to show support for the community.

Home Page.

•	Pictures containing famous historical figures that shaped our world and changed the perception in society and influenced many people during their lives. 
•	A heading of moments to be remembered

Future Implementations.

<!--> Completed <--> 
### General features on each page

All Pages on the website have:
•	A responsive navigation bar at the top which allows the user to navigate through the site. To the left of the navigation bar is an image of the Spectrumind logo as well as the Spectrumind text closer to the center. To the right of the navigation bar are the links to the websites pages (Home, History, Resources and Contact). To allow a good user experience of the site, the Spectrumind text is hidden with a media query on mobile devices to prevent the navigation bar looking cluttered. When viewing with mobile devices the navigation links change to a burger toggler. This was implemented to give the site a clean look and to promote a good user experience, as users are used to seeing the burger icon when on mobile devices to navigate a site.
•	A footer which contains social media icon links to Instagram, LinkedIn and github. There is also an envelope icon which takes the user to the contact us page. Icons were used to keep the footer clean and because they are universally recognisable.

### Future Implementations

What features would you like to implement in the future on your site? Would you like to add more pages, or create login functionality? Add these plans here.

### Accessibility

Be an amazing developer and get used to thinking about accessibility in all of your projects!

This is the place to make a note of anything you have done with accessibility in mind. Some examples include:

Have you used icons and added aria-labels to enable screen readers to understand these?
Have you ensured your site meets the minimum contrast requirements?
Have you chosen fonts that are dyslexia/accessible friendly?

Code Institute have an amazing channel for all things accessibility (a11y-accessibility) I would highly recommend joining this channel as it contains a wealth of information about accessibility and what we can do as developers to be more inclusive.
