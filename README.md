# Spectrumind
Welcome to Spectrumind, a transformative online platform dedicated to promoting pride representation, raising awareness about mental health, and fostering well-being within the LGBTQ+ community and beyond. Our project is fueled by a deep commitment to creating a more inclusive and compassionate world, where every individual feels seen, accepted, and supported.
1. Pride Representation: At Spectrumind, we strive to celebrate the rich diversity of identities within the LGBTQ+ community. Our aim is to provide a safe space where individuals can freely express their authentic selves, share their stories, and find inspiration. Through empowering narratives, vibrant artwork, and engaging content, we aim to amplify voices that have been marginalized and break down societal barriers.
2. Mental Health Awareness: We recognize the profound impact that mental health has on the well-being of individuals, especially those within the LGBTQ+ community. Spectrumind is dedicated to shedding light on the unique challenges faced by this community and providing resources, support, and information to help navigate those struggles. Our goal is to reduce stigma, foster understanding, and create a culture of empathy and acceptance.
3. Well-being and Empowerment: Spectrumind believes in the power of holistic well-being. We aim to empower individuals by providing tools, resources, and guidance that promote self-care, personal growth, and resilience. Our goal is to nurture a community where mental, emotional, and physical well-being are prioritized, leading to a stronger and more vibrant community overall.

## User Experience (UX)

A group of unlikely coders with various abilities came together to produce a website dedicated to representing the LGBTQ+ community and bring awareness to others about the struggles encountered by the community throughout history and up to the current day.
The concept of the name Spectrumind developed from the idea of connecting mental wellness and the human brain and associating the light spectrum to a community defined by its rainbow colors.
Key information for the site
•	What does it mean to be a part of the LGBTQ+.
•	How can we support members of the LGBTQ+ community who suffer with feeling ostracized by society.
•	Where can we learn about the history and accomplishments of the community as well as important figures and icons.
•	What can we do to help people who struggle to understand their role in the community.
•	When do events happen throughout the year that promote awareness.

## Design
<!--> Completed <--> 
### Colour Scheme

We wanted to choose colours that reflected the environment, so we have chosen a variety of blues, purples and pinks for our site.
![Colour Palette](https://coolors.co/ff5252-e1bee7-114069-c2dfe8-bc5bbc)
<!--> Completed <--> 
### Typography

Google Fonts was used for the following fonts

Amatic and Josefin fonts are the main fonts used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. Amatic and Josefin are clean fonts used frequently in programming, so they are both attractive and appropriate.
<!--> Completed <--> 
### Imagery

The colors were chosen to be bright and representative of the rainbow colors of the LGBTQ+ community but paler to incorporate proffesionalism in to the scheme. The pictures were chosen from the website freepik.com and found through searching by words of acceptance, support, understanding, love, thinking, and various other LGBTQ+ related phrases. The images chosen also kept close to the color scheme and draws attention to the section they are attached to.

<!--> Completed <--> 
### General features on each page

All Pages on the website have:
•	A responsive navigation bar at the top which allows the user to navigate through the site. To the left of the navigation bar is an image of the Spectrumind logo as well as the Spectrumind text closer to the center. To the right of the navigation bar are the links to the websites pages (Home, History, Resources and Contact). To allow a good user experience of the site, the Spectrumind text is hidden with a media query on mobile devices to prevent the navigation bar looking cluttered. When viewing with mobile devices the navigation links change to a burger toggler. This was implemented to give the site a clean look and to promote a good user experience, as users are used to seeing the burger icon when on mobile devices to navigate a site.
•	A footer which contains social media icon links to Instagram, LinkedIn and github. There is also an envelope icon which takes the user to the contact us page. Icons were used to keep the footer clean and because they are universally recognisable.

## Deployment & Local Development

<!--> Need to add deployment link <--> 
### Deployment

- This site was developed in IDE (Gitpod)[https://www.gitpod.io/] and deployed to (Heroku)(https://www.heroku.com/)]
- GitHub is used for version control and hosting platform for the site.
- It was built using the Django framework.
- The site was developed by previewing the site in the browser through Port 8000 in Gitpod by running the command `python3 manage.py runserver` in the terminal.

Changes and entries to the workspace were then committed and pushed to this Github repository.

### Setting up the project in Gitpod workspace:
1. Install django by running the following command `pip3 install Django`
2. Install gunicorn for running the deployed website `pip3 install gunicorn`
3. To install postgres to support the database `pip3 install dj_database_url pyscopg2`
4. Install any other required libraries by running similar commands and add them to a requirements.txt file so that Heroku will install them at deployment. This is done by running `pip3 freeze --local > requirements` in the terminal and can be run again when necessary to add further libraries.
5. Create your Django project by entering the following command: `django-admin startproject < YOUR PROJECT NAME >`
6. To create a django app, run `python manage.py startapp < YOUR APP NAME >`
7. Add the name of the newly created app to "INSTALLED_APPS" in settings.py.
8. Development of apps can begin from here.
### Deploying to Heroku
1. Once logged into Heroku, choose the option 'Create App'.
2. Attach the database in the Resources tab in Add-ons. Search for 'Heroku Postgres' and add.
3. In your workspace, create an env.py file which will store environment variable and add it to .gitignore so as not to expose any sensitive information publicly in Github.
4. Store your 'SECRET_KEY' and 'DATABASE_URL' here and import into settings.py
5. In Heroku, under settings, choose 'Reveal Config Vars and add your 'SECRET_KEY' and 'DATABASE_URL'.
6. Migrate to the database in Gitpod using `python manage.py makemigrations` followed by `python manage.py migrate`
7. Add your Heroku app URL to "ALLOWED_HOSTS" in settings.py.
8. Create a Procfile in the top level of the directory and add `web: gunicorn projectname.wsgi` so Heroku knows how to run the project.
### Initial deployment:
1. Push any changes to Github after connecting your Heroku app to your repository.
2. Add DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC with a value of 1 to Heroku config vars.
3. Select Github in Deployment method and choose 'Deploy branch' under Manual Deploy, ensuring your main branch is chosen.

## Testing

Start as you mean to go on - and get used to writing a TESTING.md file from the very first project!

Testing requirements aren't massive for your first project, however if you start using a TESTING.md file from your first project you will thank yourself later when completing your later projects, which will contain much more information.
  
Use this part of the README to link to your TESTING.md file - you can view the example TESTING.md file [here](milestone1-testing.md)

###  Acknowledgments

If someone helped you out during your project, you can acknowledge them here! For example someone may have taken the time to help you on slack with a problem. Pop a little thank you here with a note of what they helped you with (I like to try and link back to their GitHub or Linked In account too). This is also a great place to thank your mentor and tutor support if you used them.
