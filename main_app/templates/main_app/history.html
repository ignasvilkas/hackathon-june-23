                    should be acknowledged and celebrated. Let's embrace inclusivity, promote acceptance, and honor the
                    LGBTQ+ community for their rich and varied contributions to society. Love is love, and everyone
                    deserves to be respected and celebrated for who they are. Happy Pride! 🏳️‍🌈

                    <span class="rainbow">Colette, the legendary French author</span>, lived openly as a bisexual woman.
                    She had relationships with
                    prominent queer women, including Napoleon's niece Mathilde 'Missy' de Morny. In 1907, a
                    groundbreaking moment occurred when Colette and Missy shared a kiss on stage at the Moulin Rouge,
                    leading to police involvement. Colette's notable works include the novels 'Gigi' and the 'Claudine'
                    series, where the titular character grows to resent her husband and seeks solace in the arms of
                    another woman. Happy Pride! 🏳️‍🌈

                    Within the hallowed walls of the <span class="rainbow">Stonewall bar</span>, a storm of passion and
                    defiance brewed. In the face

                    <span class="rainbow">Marsha Johnson</span>, a Black trans woman, was a prominent leader in the
                    LGBTQ+ movement in NYC. She
                    advocated for marginalized groups, co-founded the groundbreaking STAR shelter for homeless trans
                    youth, and played a vital role in the Stonewall Riots. Sadly, her death in 1992, ruled as suicide
                    but suspected as murder, remains controversial. In 2019, plans were announced for a monument
                    honoring Johnson and Sylvia Rivera, recognizing transgender women's contributions. Happy Pride!
